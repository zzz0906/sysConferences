# Readme

This repository contains a Python-based web scraper and timeline for top-tier systems conference papers. The ranking of the conferences considered is higher than CCF-B or CORE-A.

## Timeline

We've created a simple timeline to visualize the submission deadlines for these conferences, using 2020 and 2021 conference timestamps as raw data. The submission deadlines tend to be consistent across years, providing a useful reference for planning.

* Use the timeline to determine the appropriate preparation time for your paper
